<h1>What is FAI? Main Features</h1>
<ul>
<li> A tool for automated unattended installation. Lazy system administrators like it.
<li> Remote network installation of different Linux flavors
<li> Easy-to-use centralized management system for your Linux deployment.
<li> FAI profiles extend the FAI class concept
<li> FAI shows a curses based menu for selecting a profile
<li> It's fast. It only takes a few minutes for a complete installation.
<li> Scalable. FAI users manage their computer infrastructures starting
 from a few computers up to several thousands of machines.
<li> Easy creation of customized Linux installation media like CD, DVD or USB stick
<li> Autodiscover of the FAI install server when doing a network installation
<li> Different hardware and different configuration requirements are easy to
establish using FAI. <br>You do not need to repeat information that is shared
among several machines.
<li> Using the FAI class concept, you can group a bunch of similar machines.
<li> Installation targets: desktops, servers, notebooks, Beowulf cluster, rendering or web server farm, Linux laboratory or classroom.
<li> Linux rollout, mass installation and automated server provisioning are additional topics of FAI.
<li> FAI is lightweight. No special daemons are running, no database setup
is needed.<br>It's architecture independent, since it consists
only of shell, Perl and Cfengine scripts.
<li> Besides initial installations, it is also used for daily maintenance.
<li> Creating customized chroot environments
<li> Building your own disk image for cloud instances
<li> Cloning machines using disk images is supported
<li> Also bare-metal provisioning and deploying virtual machines is supported
<li> Compared to tools like kickstart or cobbler for Red Hat, autoyast for SUSE or
Jumpstart for SUN Solaris, FAI is much more flexible.<br>You can tune every
small part of your configuration to your local needs using hooks.
<li> More technical information in the <a href=/poster>flyer and poster</a>
</ul>

<h1>FAI History</h1>
FAI is rock-solid. It's now more than 16 years old. FAI was started in 1999 at
the University of Cologne, when
<a href="http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/~lange">Thomas</a> had to
organize an installation of a Linux cluster. Today, FAI is regularly used in <a href="/reports/">varying environments</a>,
ranging from a dozen machines up to several thousands machines.
